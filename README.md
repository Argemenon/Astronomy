# Astronomy and Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains various astronomy-related data analysis and physics-based simulation projects.

## Features
- Simulations using Lagrangian Mechanics
- Analysis of Astronomical Data
- Scientific computing tools for solving equations

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the simulations, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Pandas
- vpython

Understanding simulations would be easier if you are familiar with physics. Most of the classical problems are solved here using Lagrangian Mechanics


I hope you learn someting!
